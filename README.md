# Python-Nearest-Neighbour-Algorithm
We are given a set of cities, which we will think of as points with coordinates. The problem is to start at a particular point, 
visit all other points once and only once, returning finally to the starting point, and in doing so to travel the minimum possible
total distance. In this project I implement the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm using Python to try and find a solution to this problem.
